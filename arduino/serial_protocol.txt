=======================================

All communication is initiated by the laptop.

The laptop sends a one-byte command identifier, followed by zero or
more data bytes.  The number of data bytes is constant for each
command.

Whenever the Arduino receives a command, it sends back one or more
bytes in response.  If there is no response, the command was not read
successfully.

Command 0x00: are you awake?
	      0 bytes data
	      arduino responds with 0x00

Command 0x01: set motor speeds
	      2 bytes data: left motor speed and right motor speed
              arduino responds with 0x00

Command 0x02: read IR sensor
              1 byte data: index of IR sensor to read
	      arduino responds with the one-byte mesured sensor value

Command 0x03: new destination point
		8 bytes, dist_to_target, theta_to_target

Command 0x04: correction to destination point
		8 bytes, dist_to_target, theta_to_target
