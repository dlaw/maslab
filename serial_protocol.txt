=======================================

All communication is initiated by the laptop.

The laptop sends a one-byte command identifier, followed by zero or
more data bytes.  The number of data bytes is constant for each
command.

Whenever the Arduino receives a command, it sends back one or more
bytes in response.  If there is no response, the command was not read
successfully.

Command 0x00: are you awake?
	      0 bytes data
	      arduino responds with 0x00

Command 0x01: set motor speeds
	      2 bytes data: left motor speed and right motor speed
              arduino responds with 0x00

Command 0x02: read IR sensor
              1 byte data: index of IR sensor to read
	      arduino responds with the one-byte mesured sensor value

Command 0x03: rotate in place
		4 bytes, angle to rotate (in radians << 16)
	    arduino responds with 0x00

Command 0x04: go to new point
		8 bytes, distance to target (in wheel "ticks"), angle to target (in radians << 16)
		arduino responds with 0x00


Command 0x05: ask for angle to destination
		0 bytes,
		arduino responds with 4 bytes, containing the current angle to destination

Command 0x06: ask for distance to destination
		0 bytes,
		arduino responds with 4 bytes, containing the current distance to destination

Command 0x07: change a parameters
		3 bytes total:
			1 byte for the parameter number
				0 - distance between the wheels
				1 - accuracy threshold for distance (in motor ticks)
				2 - accuracy threshold for rotations (in radians << 16)
				3 - proportional gain for rotation in place
				4 - proportional gain for rotation while moving
				5 - proportional gain for velocity
			2 bytes for the parameter value (signed)
		arduino responds with 1 byte, echoing the parameter number

Command 0x09: ask for battery voltage,
		0 bytes
		arduino responds with 2 bytes, containing the 10bit battery voltage
