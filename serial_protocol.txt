=======================================

All communication is initiated by the laptop.

The laptop sends a one-byte command identifier, followed by zero or
more data bytes.  The number of data bytes is constant for each
command.

Whenever the Arduino receives a command, it sends back one or more
bytes in response.  If there is no response, the command was not read
successfully.

Command 0x00: are you awake?
	      0 bytes data
	      arduino r esponds with 0x00

Command 0x01: set drive motor speeds (open loop)
	      2 bytes data: left motor speed and right motor speed
              arduino responds with 0x00

Command 0x02: read analog data
              1 byte data: index of analog input to read
	      arduino responds with the one-byte mesured voltage

Command 0x03: has the start switch been switched?
	      0 bytes data
	      arduino responds with 0x01 if the start switch is on, 0x00 otherwise.

Command 0x04: get bump sensors
	      0 bytes data
	      Arduino responds with the following bitmap char:
	      (1 indicates unpressed, 0 indicates depressed)
			MSB ----------------------------------------------------- LSB
			[NA][NA][Front-left][F-r][Back-left][B-r][Veryback-left][Vb-r]

Command 0x05: set other motor
	      2 bytes data
	      first byte: motor to switch (0 = helix, 1 = sucker, 2 = door)
	      second byte: new value (0 = off/closed, 1 = on/open)
	      responds with 0x00

Command 0x06: set drive motor speeds (closed loop)
	      2 ints data: us between left motor ticks and us between right motor ticks
	      responds with 0x00
