=======================================

All communication is initiated by the laptop.

The laptop sends a one-byte command identifier, followed by zero or
more data bytes.  The number of data bytes is constant for each
command.

Whenever the Arduino receives a command, it sends back one or more
bytes in response.  If there is no response, the command was not read
successfully.

Command 0x00: are you awake?
	      0 bytes data
	      arduino responds with 0x00

Command 0x01: set motor speeds (open loop)
	      2 bytes data: left motor speed and right motor speed
              arduino responds with 0x00

Command 0x02: read IR sensor
              1 byte data: index of IR sensor to read
	      arduino responds with the one-byte mesured sensor value

Command 0x07: change a parameters
		3 bytes total:
			1 byte for the parameter number
				0 - distance between the wheels
				1 - accuracy threshold for distance (in motor ticks)
				2 - accuracy threshold for rotations (in radians << 16)
				3 - proportional gain for rotation in place
				4 - proportional gain for rotation while moving
				5 - proportional gain for velocity
			2 bytes for the parameter value (signed)
		arduino responds with 1 byte, echoing the parameter number

Command 0x09: ask for battery voltage,
		0 bytes
		arduino responds with 2 bytes, containing the 10bit battery voltage

Command 0x0A: set motor velocity (closed loop)
		8 bytes total
		4 bytes for left motor velocity (signed int)	|period between encoder ticks
		4 bytes for right motor velocity (signed int)	|valid from ~0x00 00 02 50 --Â 0x00 00 40 00
		responds with 0x00

Command 0x0B: has the switch been switched?
		0 bytes sent
		arduino responds with 0xFF if the switch is on, 0x00 otherwise.
